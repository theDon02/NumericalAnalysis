# Numerical Methods Project
### What is it about?
In my undergrad studies my major was focused on approximating math equations using numerical methods. I want to create a program that will test what I learned. This project will contain the basic methods for solving linear equations. Eventually I would like to write a Finite Element Program that will solve a PDE.

### What methods will be implemeted in this project?
I will have fun with this and I will write the methods implemented as I go.

### What technologies will be used?
1. C++: I like the speed of this programming language. And my first program I learned was C but I love the OOP.
2. CMAKE: I want learn and experiment with this software. I have experience with Makefile, but CMAKE will create the Makefile no matter the operating system that will be running my project
